# Dependencies

Every package in this application's runtime tree, `requirements.txt`,
chosen directly or brought in by another. Each was checked against the
public registry: the name resolves to the canonical project named here,
not a lookalike. Versions live in the lockfile, not here. The doctrine
job fails when the tree holds a package with no row, or a row names a
package the tree no longer holds (build-doctrine D-039).

## Adoption records

Packages read in full when they arrived, beyond the registry check.

### opentelemetry-api

Read October 5, 2026, when FastAPI 0.142 brought it into this tree.

- Registry: the name resolves to the OpenTelemetry project,
  github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python, under the Cloud Native
  Computing Foundation; license Apache-2.0, compatible with this
  repository's license.
- The project, read by build-doctrine's `scripts/vet.py`: Scorecard 7.8
  of 10; Best Practices passing. Scorecard's vulnerability count, 48,
  belongs to the project's repository; the version installed here has no
  known vulnerability in the OSV database.
- The package: pure Python, no compiled code, no install-time code, one
  dependency (typing-extensions, already in the tree). It imports no
  module that opens a connection or a process; it uses urllib.parse to
  encode strings, and `requests` appears only in documentation
  examples. Without an SDK, which nothing here installs, its providers
  are the no-op ones, so it records and sends nothing.
- Pinned to: the hash in requirements.txt. Fetched through: the registry,
  hash verified on install.
- Runs with: the application's process, no secret, no egress of its own.
- Accepted by: Terry Taylor, on merge of the pull request that added
  this record.
- Expires: October 5, 2027, or when a release adds a dependency or an
  SDK is installed, whichever comes first.
